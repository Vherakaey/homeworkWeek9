It appears thatrecovery of healthy corals at deeper sites was significant. For example at convention 18m,the recovery was from <10% live tissue growth from over 45% living cover, to over 25%tissue with zooxanthellae. This represents an increase in coral tissue withzooxanthellae of over 150% six months after the bleaching was recorded.At Hilarys Reef, the coral at 18m was left with <10% cover with zooxanthellae afterthe bleaching event in August, but recovered to over 20% (another 100%+ recovery rate) in6 months. Pavona clavus tissue at Hilarys Reef showed considerable recovery ofzooxanthellae, with many of the colonies becoming pigmented at medium (12m) depths sixmonths after August. Here, healthy corals significantly changed from acover of less than 5% in September 1998 to over 60% by August 2000. This 55% increase inhealthy coral tissue was related to existing P. clavus colonies regaining their zooxanthellae..What was encouraging was the recovery of live coral one year after the bleachingevent. At Hilarys Reef 18m (5 to 23%), Convention 12m (5 to 18%), Convention18m (3 to 30%) there were all rises in the population of healthy (pigmented) coral tissue.These changes were not statistically significant, but were important trends at deeper depthsthat showed positive change in coral percent cover for these areas. Bleached coralpopulations fell considerably over the first year of observations.At Convention reef, diverse coral forms such as Porites cylindrica, Sarcophyton spp.and bottlebrush Acropora spp. were all damaged, with at least over 50% of their tissuebleached. The branching coral Pocillopora damicornis was observed in threequadrats in two different locations, and appeared not to have beached as readily as otherAcropora sp. branching and digitate life-forms.","1 m2 quadrat, with photographics and insitu observation",,31C,,"Bleaching occurred over  August and September 1998. Corals were affected to a depth of 18m. Percentage of bleached corals was seen to range from 35 to 90% between 0 and 25m depth around the whole island. The reduction in percent corals bleached at all depths over the first year of observation was dramatic (live coral cover fell from a maximum of 80% for all depths to between 0 and 10% in 1999). Around Danjugan, these areas were dominated by colonies of branching Acropora spp. and Seriatopora hystrix. Initially, an average of around 80% of corals from all depths were bleached at Hilarys Reef. Corals that bleached were dominated by P. clavus in the shallow depths of Hilarys Reef. In deeper depths, more delicate plating forms such as were seen to bleach, but not as severely as the P. clavus from the 6m quadrats.Bleaching over the shallower areas was also recorded in soft coral forms (Sinularia flexibilis, other Sinularia spp. and Sarcophyton spp.).

As of 10/29/05, over 95% of A. formosa in Nuuuli pool, Tutuila, American Samoa are partly bleached.  Mike King reports similar bleaching in Alofau pool, Tutuila.  They recovered from the previous summer's bleaching just 5 months ago.<br>Some have suggested that due to rising temperatures from global warming, in the future coral reefs may bleach every summer.  This is already happening in the pools of American Samoa.  Because it is a regular, annual event, and there are several possible controls, this offers an opportunity for scientists to plan studies of bleaching instead of having to take advantage of unpredictable opportunities.<br>For the past two Austral summers, I have recorded the bleaching of three species of staghorn Acropora  (A. formosa, A. pulchra, and A. nobilis) in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  Acopora formosa and Porites cylindrica dominate the pools of Tutuila, but P. cylindrica was not observed to bleach.  Bleaching of the three staghorns has reached as high as 100 percent of the colonies in some of the pools, with colonies nearly entirely white.  At the same time, very few corals on the outer reef slopes were observed bleaching.  Acropora nobilis is present on the outer slopes (though not common), and did not bleach there when the same species strongly bleached in the pools.  The pools reach higher temperatures than on the outer slopes.  Most of the pools had peak temperatures of 32-33 oC in the last summer, but one hit a peak of 34.9 oC (for a half hour).  The highest temperatures occur on sunny summer days when low tide is midday, reducing circulation.  High temperatures are well known in the pools of nearby Ofu island, American Samoa (Craig, Birkeland, and Belliveau, 2001).  Those pools have a higher diversity of corals and less bleaching.<br>Mass coral bleaching on outer reef slopes was observed by several people in American Samoa in 2002 and 2003, though the time and intensity were not recorded.  At present, about half of all staghorn colonies in the pools are dead.  Essentially none have died in the past two years, so it is likely they died in 2002 and/or 2003, when bleaching was more intense.  Thus, along with the present bleaching, staghorns in the pools have bleached for five years in a row. <br>    In 2004, staghorns in the pools began to bleach in March, peaked in April, and ended in August.  Bleaching started again in November (04), peaked in the January to April (05) period, and ended at the end of May (05).  Now bleaching has started again at the end of October (05).  Pool staghorns are spending more of the year bleached than recovered, year after year."Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,"Nuuuli, Tutuila",-14.327,-170.703,3,2004,2-5m,2,Medium,,"Acropora 	microphthama ,Acropora pulchra, Acropora nobilis",40%,,0,,,,Diver observations/measurements,appx. 1000m square,,,"Average Hard coral: 25% Soft coral: 0%Bleached Hard coral: 40% Soft coral: 0%Affected Species and percentage of bleaching: Acropora 	microphthama - 	75%Acropora pulchra -  	75%Acropora 	nobils - 	75%Porites 	cylindrca - 	0%Pavona 	frondifea - 0%Only partly bleached, on the upper surfaces."Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,"Nu'uuli, Tutuila",-14.32,-170.679,3,2002,10m (reefslope),0,No Bleaching,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,"Olisega Village, Olisega",-14.128,-169.626,3,2002,Reef slope,1,Low,"Faviidae, Poritidae",Montastrea curta and some Porites,1-10%,,0,,,,,,,,Very little paling of Montastrea curta and some PoritesPacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,"Onesosopo, Tutuila",-14.284,-170.665,3,2002,10 (slope),1,Low,Fungidae,Fungia,1-10%,,0,,,,,,,,Pale mushroom coralPacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,"Sili, Olisega",-14.164,-169.634,3,2002,12m (Reef slope),1,Low,"Faviidae, Agariciidae, Alcyoniidae","Montastrea curta, Leptorina, Pavona, Lobophytum",1-10%,,0,,,,,,,,"Very little paling of Montastrea curta, Leptorina and few Pavona"Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,Tutuila Island,-14.3,-170.7,3,1994,40,3,HIGH,,,70-80,,,,,,,,,,Bleaching in 1994 was much more severe than the previous event in 1991. Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,Tutuila Lagoons,-14.284,-170.674,3,2004,,1,Low,Acroporidae,"Major species affected- Acropora staghorn (3 species) Acropora palifera and A. cf. listeri - very minor bleaching",1-5%,,0,"No mortality from bleaching in 2004 but about half of the lagoon staghorn beds are dead and covered with algae, appearing to be dead at least a year.

About 1/4 to 3/4 of living staghorns are at least partially bleached in 3 lagoons on Tutuila.  Only upper surfaces of horizontal branches have any bleaching (usually it is only partial even on upper surfaces); undersides always retain some color.  No colonies are totally bleached, none recently dead.  A few A. palifera and A. cf. listeri are bleached, but there are very few colonies of these species in the lagoons.  Other species are not bleached.  Bleaching was first seen on March 20.  The last previous check of these corals was on Feb 28.     Temperature loggers in one lagoon show temperatures rising to a peak averaging a little over 30C in mid-February, and remaining fairly steady since then.  Peak temperatures reach 32C for a few hours on some days.  These 3 lagoons have little water circulating into them at low tide.  25-75% of staghorns in the more closed lagoons are bleached.  Similar areas with the same staghorns that have open circulation with the ocean have very little bleaching (about 1-5%).  Reef fronts that have been looked at also have no bleaching, but do not have these staghorns.    I am told that last year there was strong bleaching of the staghorns, and there was bleaching in the previous summer as well.Records from temperature loggers show that the sea surface temperature in American Samoa was heating up in December and early January.  When Hurricane Heta hit on Jan 6, 2004 it caused a sudden large drop in sea surface temperatures, most likely due to wave mixing of surface waters with cooler deeper water.  After Jan 6, sea surface temperature began to warm again, starting at a new lower base.  So in effect, Hurricane Heta reset the summer warming of surface waters.  Presumably then the maximum temperatures that were reached were lower than they would have been otherwise, and bleaching was more mild than it would have been otherwise.  Normal summer bleaching here may be closer to that experienced in the previous two summers, when mass bleaching of perhaps 20-30% of corals on reef slopes was followed by the death of some table corals on slopes and some staghorns and fire coral in lagoons."Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,"Utulei, Tutuila",-14.286,-170.685,3,2004,1-7m,1,Low,,"Acropora 	microphthama",3%,,0,,,,Diver observations/measurements,appx. 1000m square,,,"Average Hard coral: 40% Soft coral: 1%Bleached Hard coral: 3% Soft coral: 0%Affected Species and percentage of bleaching: Acropora 	microphthama - 5%Porites 	cyindrica - 0%Porites l	obata - 0%"Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,"Vatia, Tutuila",-14.264,-170.6678,3,2002,reef slope,1,Low,"Faviidae, Acroporidae","Favia stelligera, Montipora venosa, Branching and plate Aropora",10-40%,,,,,,,,,,"3-6m - 40% bleached10 m - <10% bleached"Pacific,Micronesia,Federated States of Micronesia,Yap,9.516666667,138.1666667,9,1998,20,1,Low,,,20,,,,,,,,,,Minimal bleachingPacific,Micronesia,Marshall Islands,Majuro,7.01,171.367,9,2002,very shallow,1,Low,"Acroporidae, Pocilloporidae, Zoanthidae","Acropora seriata(?), A. nobilis, Pocillopora, Zooanthid",entire atoll (?),,,Corals that belached in September are dead and covered with a green film of algae in Nov.,,,,,"unconfrontably warm, almost hot","Unusually low tides on Sept 9 & 10, still hot weather on Sept 1","Entire atoll experience bleaching (?)Uppermost intertidal Acropora (blue axial tips, A. seriata?) comingled with a rose-colored Pocillopora.

By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps, mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth, especially in localized areas of high turbidity.  The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October, but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.
